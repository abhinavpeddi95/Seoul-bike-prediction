# Seoul Bike Rental Demand Prediction

This repository contains code and resources for predicting the bike rental demand in Seoul. The project utilizes a dataset of historical bike rental records to train and evaluate machine learning models for demand prediction.

# Dataset
The dataset used in this project is sourced from the Seoul Bike Sharing System. It includes information such as date, time, weather conditions, and the number of bikes rented. The dataset can be found in the google drive link. 

# Project Structure
The repository is structured as follows:

<b>Seoul_bike_prediction.csv</b>: This file contains the dataset used for training and testing the models. To view the dataset click [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lfgJXAJJIYmSJq6Tj4feqPBUQfEBndh6/view?usp=drive_link)
